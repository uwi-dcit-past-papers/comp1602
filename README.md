# COMP1602 Past Paper Practice
Welcome to COMP1602 Past Paper Practice repository. This repository contains past paper questions that can help you prepare for your exams.

## Usage
Each past paper is organized by `semester/year`, and each question is in the form qN, where N is the question number. The past paper in PDF format can also be found in the corresponding `semester/year` folder, named as _paper.pdf_.

Code blocks with a comment of _testing_ are unneeded in the exam and made for proving the answer. You can safely ignore them when studying.
